# Introduction

## What is mdconvert?

**mdconvert** is a self-hosted web tool that converts `.docx` and `.pdf` files into clean Markdown, optimized for use with AI agents, Claude Projects, and Claude Code.

When you feed documents to an AI, raw text is often not enough — especially for SOPs, manuals, or guides that contain images. mdconvert solves this by:

1. Extracting images from Word documents
2. Sending each image to AI Vision (Gemini / OpenAI / Anthropic)
3. Generating a detailed text description for each image
4. Assembling everything into a single Markdown file

The result is a `full.md` that an AI can fully understand — even the visual parts.

## Use Cases

| Use case | How mdconvert helps |
|---|---|
| **Claude Projects** | Upload SOP or manual as Markdown context — Claude understands every image |
| **Claude Code** | Drop `full.md` into your project so Claude Code has full context |
| **AI Agents** | Feed structured Markdown to your agent instead of raw PDFs |
| **Knowledge base** | Convert company documentation to Markdown for indexing |
| **Translation / editing** | Edit Markdown output in the built-in editor before using |

## Two Conversion Flows

```
DOCX → Pandoc → extract text + images → AI Vision → full.md + text-only.md + images/

PDF  → Ghostscript → compress → AI Vision (page by page) → text-only.md
```

## Key Features

- **Batch upload** — convert multiple files in one session
- **Multi AI provider** — Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic — switchable from the UI
- **Inline editor** — preview and edit Markdown before downloading
- **Auto cleanup** — files deleted after 24h
- **Self-hosted** — your data stays on your server
- **Bilingual prompts** — English and Vietnamese presets
